<h1>John Wick</h1>

John Wick is a 2014 American neo-noir action thriller film directed by Chad Stahelski (in his feature directorial debut) and written by Derek Kolstad. It stars Keanu Reeves, Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Adrianne Palicki, Bridget Moynahan, Dean Winters, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo, and Willem Dafoe. It is the first installment in the John Wick film series. The story follows former hitman John Wick and his attempt to hunt down the men who broke into his home, stole his vintage car, and killed his puppy, which was a last gift to him from his recently deceased wife.

Stahelski and David Leitch directed the film together, though only Stahelski was credited. Kolstad had completed the screenplay in 2012 and further developed it for Thunder Road Pictures. Stahelski and Leitch previously worked with Reeves as stunt doubles on The Matrix trilogy. Stahelski and Leitch's approach to fight scenes drew upon their admiration for anime and martial arts films. The film used fight choreographers and gun fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema. The film also pays homage to works such as John Woo's The Killer, Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Cercle Rouge and Le Samouraï, John Boorman's Point Blank, and Spaghetti Western films.

John Wick premiered at the Fantastic Fest on September 19, 2014, and was released theatrically in the United States on October 24, by Summit Entertainment. The film grossed $86 million worldwide against its budget of $20–30 million and received generally positive reviews from critics, with praises for its action sequences, visual style, and Reeves's performances (which many viewed as his comeback role). It went on to be regarded as one of the best action films of all time.
